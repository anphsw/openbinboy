This is firmware pack/unpack utility for jboot-based routers.
You also need squashfs and unsquashfs (you can get it from firmware-mod-kit) of corresponding versions.

OpenSource replacement for binboy from SDK found in:
D-Link DWR-521 Rev.B
D-Link DWR-921
Zyxel LTE 3301
Zyxel LTE 3311
Lava Telecom LR-25G001


Now only sanity check (with all CRC calculations) and header display finished.
./openbinboy [-c] < -i input.bin | -x input.bin >

  -c      Use old style jboot CRC for some calculations (DWR-921 and others), if you see CRC mismatches, try this option
  -i      Print headers and do sanity check on whole firmware or single container
  -x      Extract files from whole firmware to bootloader.bin + kernel.bin + rootfs.bin + branding.bin
